            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p class="info">My friends and I discovered this recipe one winter a few years ago and it was an instant favorite. It was a very cold winter and we knew we were about to be snowed in for a week or more. We ended up making a double batch and it lasted us for days. Since then, at least once a year, we come together and make a big pot for Sunday dinner.</p>
