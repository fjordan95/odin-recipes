            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I thought this up one night when I was craving cheese bread. I lived alone and I can't stand wasting food, so I needed a quick solution. I found that the key to really good cheese bread is full fat cheese and a lot of butter.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>6 in. pita rounds</li>
                    <li>butter</li>
                    <li>minced garlic</li>
                    <li>full fat mozzarella</li>
                    <li>feta crumbles</li>
                    <li>italian seasoning</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Melt the butter and mix in a tbsp of garlic</li>
                    <li>Brush pita rounds with a generous amount of butter mixture</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle on shreds of mozzarella and a few crumbles of feta</li>
                    <li>Bake at 400 until cheese is melted, then top broil until the edges are crisp</li>
                </ol>
